File security manager: A java application where we give an existing text file name as input
and the output will be a text file with unreadable code. This application will basically secure
the text file by converting our source file into a secured file. It will also convert the secured
file into original file when required.
Definition Of Done:
a) System should ask the user to enter a text file name and validate if the file is existing or not.
b) It will use some security algorithm and key to convert the source file into a secured file.
c) it will ask user to enter a number and generate exception if the entered number is not as per
the security algorithm used.
d) It will prompt user to enter the security key to get the original file from the secured file.
e) The algorithm and key should be same as above while converting the secured file to original
file otherwise exception will be generated.
